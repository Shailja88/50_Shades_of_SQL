# 50 Shades of SQL Queries

Welcome to **50 Shades of SQL Queries**â€”an in-depth revision guide featuring 50 essential SQL queries to elevate your database management skills. ðŸŒ¹ðŸ”¥

## ðŸ“š About This Project
This document is a versatile reference for mastering SQL queries. Ideal for interview preparation, SQL fundamental refreshers, or advancing database operation knowledge, this collection spans a wide range of concepts to boost your proficiency.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
The queries are systematically categorized to streamline learning:

1. **Basic Queries**
   - `SELECT` statements
   - Filtering with `WHERE`
   - Sorting with `ORDER BY`
   - Limiting results with `LIMIT`

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Using `BETWEEN`, `IN`, `LIKE`
   - Handling `NULL` values effectively

3. **Joins**
   - `INNER JOIN`
   - `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
   - `FULL JOIN`
   - Using `ON` to specify join conditions
   - Using `USING` for shared column names

4. **Aggregation & Grouping**
   - `GROUP BY` for summarizing data
   - Aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
   - Refining results with `HAVING`

5. **Subqueries**
   - Single-row subqueries
   - Multi-row subqueries
   - Correlated subqueries for complex conditions

6. **Set Operations**
   - Combining results with `UNION`
   - Identifying common data with `INTERSECT`
   - Differentiating results using `EXCEPT`

7. **Modifying Data**
   - Adding records with `INSERT`
   - Updating records using `UPDATE`
   - Removing data with `DELETE`

8. **Indexes & Constraints**
   - Creating efficient indexes
   - Implementing data integrity through constraints

9. **Advanced Concepts**
   - Mastering window functions
   - Utilizing CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
   - Managing operations with transactions

## âš¡ How to Use
- Progress through each section methodically.
- Practice queries on a sample database.
- Modify queries to test different scenarios.
- Review comments for insights and best practices.

## ðŸ›  Requirements
- An SQL-compatible database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
- An SQL client for query execution (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, pgAdmin).

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Effective Learning
- Focus on understanding the logic behind each query.
- Challenge yourself by writing queries from scratch.
- Analyze query outcomes to grasp underlying operations.
